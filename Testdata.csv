1,"I have no idea why this is a separate ticket system, and I have never succeeded in making the UI work.",
2,Incredibly cumbersome and clunky (TAG Tasks for example).  Not easy to navigate at all.  Not intuitive.  Advanced searching practically requires coding experience.  Knowledge base searching is also less than ideal.,
3,Hard to be satisfied with a tool that makes it so hard to do your job.,
4,Remedy is terrible. slow. times out ALL THE TIME. the dropdowns for selecting a client mnemonic are terrible - does anyone from the Remedy team actually use them? Why are they so bad?!?,
5,Tool is so slow and constantly hangs.  Especially in Asset Management.  Just a mess in general.,
6,"Remedy is the worst issue tracking software I've evere used.  Some of my IT industry friends asked what we used and were surprised that a company like Cerner uses Remedy. It's hard to navigate, we close tickets, and then the next day they show back up in our queue wiht all the information lost, we can't tell who is ticket dumping because we only see their Cerner log in ID and can't contact  them via Skype for more info since we can no longer look up their names",
7,So bad. Please please replace or fix Remedy!,
8,"slow, not user friendly, takes forever to create tickets.",
9,very poor performance!,
10,very hard to figure out who i should be opening the ticket with.,
11,"It has been very slow and often requires a refresh of the connection, which blanks out anything you were doing.  This wastes loads of time re-entering information in CR or searching in the system for data.",
12,Confusing and I never have access to the things I need. I constantly have to log tickets to be allowed to do various things...,
13,slow and klunky,
14,slooooooow,

20,"When Remedy times out, I cannot log back in on any browser for weeks",
21,"Soooo sloooow. I also with the ""email"" box would close once we successfully send an email.",
22,even more clicks than Navigator,
23,"it's getting slower and slower.  Workflow is clunky, messaging from web services (WSI SRAPP) is not good, does not specify the problem, only that there is one.",
24,"Slow, has very slow and weak search capabilities.",
25,"Slow, unreliable, high resistance to enabling features/functionality in the product",
26,"Slow to use, too much downtime, mobile app please!",
27,Sometimes unreliable. Difficult to remember all of the required fields as they aren't all marked with *'s. not entirely intuitive either. I prefer navigator as all the fields you need are face up in front of you.,
28,"It works but I am not a fan of it. I do understand the need for change requests and inventory however, I just do not like it as a ticketing system.",
29,"Remedy is NOT user friendly nor is it intuitive.  Once you learn it's quirks, you're ok... until then - it's painful. :)",

31,Raising a ticket has become dificult,
32,"very bad performance in germany, often results in timeouts",
33,"Slow, bulky",
34,"Very slow, has improved some.  However latest upgrade was a disaster and forced everyone to audit all of the nodes to make sure information was still correct",
35,SO slow and consistently crashes,
36,Remedy is a daily struggle.  Constantly spools,
37,"I tested Remedy in a former company, this is a great application but the system here is still buggy- KB articles are lost in translation, hard to maintain, and searching for them is like searching for a needle in a haystack but that haystack in covered in time stealing ooze...you get the drift",
38,this is very difficult still for me to connect to and use,
39,"Buggy, errors out a lot",
40,reports are awful  - not one stream of chronoligical comments,
41,"It takes a long time to load a client list and I am unable to just type in a known client mnemonic, which can lead me to having to scroll through a giant list of mnemonics.",
42,Has become too slow at recent times.,
43,slow for remote users and would like mobile device access,

49,Performance issues too often.  Concerned about the addition of more users later this year.,
50,Don't use very often,
51,"I like to finally have an ITSM supporting tool. It takes away the need to feed Excel tables. On the other hand, the UI performance is weak away from KC and it is not usable without errors without a training.",
52,handling complicated,
53,"Remedy is finicky and has trouble linking with Navigator. If everyone were on Remedy, it would be easier.",
54,Super confusing to use and slow.,
55,"Remedy is easier than Navigator, however whenever tickets are transferred between us and AMS the dates are all reflective of the day it was transferred. This makes it super difficult to work through a ticket with lots of existing communication.",
56,Seems cumbersome/clunky,
57,My first attempt to login fails everytime. Why do i have to log in twice to get in?,
58,"can be slow at times, makes it difficult to work.",

60,slow to query for past CRs,
61,Can get sluggish at times,
62,sometimes very slow performance,
63,needs to have a required built in computer field mattched to asset inventory,
64,Seems like it crashes once a week. Could use some improvement on being user friendly.,

66,Works well with Google chrome,
67,"SSO was a big improvement, but still times out requiring me to refresh page",

75,Good solution - as much fun as tickets can be.  So much better than Navigator for ease of use!,
76,NO MORE NAVIGATOR!,
77,"Leads/managers need to have on time reports access facility. More automation required - for each email received at common HRSC mailbox, Remedy should automatically log SR, Logs such as SR bouncing are in text format, make it tabular format for quick reference.",
78,"awful; slowness daily, it is very delayed when clicking through the Remedy pages; icons sometimes are not visible, requiring a complete computer reboot to finally display",
79,We were told we'd be making the move to remedy for solution consulting but this hasn't happened yet. I'm eagerly looking forward to the day we do!,

112,Snails could be faster,
113,"very slow, times out but appears to be open still, very painful to use",

123,New-window city,
124,"I'm deep in the admin portions, though, so I'm biased.",
125,SLOW!,
126,a tool trying to do too many things for too many people. User input fatigue at best. Poor data sources for required fields.,
127,We seriously have to move the bar.  Response times and UI are very poor.,
128,"This is a love hate thing. I love the power of reporting we have with it. Hate the maintenance. I don't work tickets anymore, but for the last year/year and a half, I spend 4-8 hours a day in this thing just to make it work for our team more efficiently.  I'm hoping that after these last rounds of changes and OCSM updates we'll be done doing this.  Really easy to put mass things in, insanely stupid to take things out. For example, I had",
129,"i struggle to see all the information that i need in remedy - however, this could just be my last of knowledge of how it works",
130,Remedy is not exactly the most intuitive in my opinion.,
131,"it's gotten better, but it feels like we're making Cerner fit how Remedy works instead of getting an application the will function the way Cerner works",
132,has been a bear to work with and the move to it is not being communicated well or trained upon,
133,constant logging out,
134,Terrible to navigate,
135,The remedy web interface is so slow and convoluted for some processes especially when modifying passwords,
136,"I believe there is a lot of issues with the Remedy platform and ServiceNow is a much better solution, though I don't think a shift will occur anytime soon.  My biggest complaints with Remedy is the slowness and navigational roadblocks to perform our job functions in a timely manner.",
137,Tool is very sow,
138,System is slow.,
139,very difficult to use,
140,hard to find what you are looking for,
141,difficult to submit tickets.  Would like to see the process made easier.  Especially when you don't know the solution/or who to submit the ticket to,
142,I find remedy extremely difficult to use when I need to review a ticket which thankfully is rare,
143,slow response time in many functions such as relationships,

155,Too difficult to navigate,
156,"Performance is a big issue, especially in the UAE and from customer sites.",
157,Its very slow,
158,sluggish,
159,Remedy and Navigator should be linked. It is pain to have to switch from one to another to move tickets. The fields are way too small and the flow isn't easy to flow. Save buttons and others at the bottom 'hide' or get chopped off depending on your resolution. The options to locate the right application type are not user friendly at all. Most of the time it looks like people just guess.,
160,just started getting exposed to it recently but doesn't seem to offer many details,
161,It is a challenge for it to be disconnected from other solutions.,
162,hate it - it is just too hard to open a ticket,
163,Sometimes does not load completely until several tries,
164,Very slow,
165,seems to be very unstable; I get thrown out of Remedy all the time,
166,So many options that may only be applicable to one or two business units. Tailoring the GUI based on differing business needs seems like it would be very helpful.,
167,Slow response times,
168,Not very intuitive. Very slow. Limited options for customization.,
169,I have little interaction with Cerner Remedy.,
170,Never used,

172,It's ok.,
173,Do not use,
174,"I hope we have a dedicated team for optimizing and facilitating working with Remedy. It would be nice if we had communication paths to that team too. If these exist, please ensure this information is accessible.",
175,Very clunky and always giving errors,
176,Complicated,
177,need to ALL teams converted to it,
178,I don´t work with this,
179,"I don't really understand the cause of this, but I can get to Remedy via the external URL from my client-side VDI on the client's network, but I cannot get to the same url from my Cerner laptop once I get behind the client's firewall (which of course also severs the direct URL).",
180,"Hey it's pretty good, but it's a CMDB with a lot of stuff.  Am I right?",
181,performance is often poor,
182,Freezes regularly.,
183,Needs iPhone/mobile app,
184,facing slow response while compiling reports,
185,From BLR office speed is a concern,
186,Remedy is very slow.,
187,Could use more ease of use and functionality in Change Management Console. Need better org integration i.e. AMS,
188,sometimes slow,
189,incident and change work  well. Asset management could use improvement.,
190,There are some features of Remedy that are a little clunky that make it difficult to use.,
191,Wonderful,
192,Haven't used it enough to talk intelligently,
193,Not used it yet,

195,Doesn't launch for my org until Sept.,
196,Our team has not started leveraging this yet,

199,Not live on it yet.,
200,We'll see after the switch over in a couple weeks.,
201,Haven't used it yet.   Just had one overview and I'm not sure how I'll like it yet.,
202,Havent used it yet,
203,what is this?,
204,Unable to speak into this yet.,
205,Not used yet,
206,I have not used,
207,Performs slow.  To many unnecessary fields that I can't pre-populate.  I've tried templates and they do not speed things up for me.  Inability to search for all network changes easily.  Bugs that don't allow others to approve my CR.,
208,no open APIs,
209,"Very slow performance, frequently crashes",
210,Terrible piece of software; it has lots of features but is not intuitive to use; Navigator was clunky but it had organization - Remedy lacks organzation and is chaotic to navigate,
211,very slow and hard to navigate,
212,I'm shocked we couldn't have found a better ticketing system than this. Getting input from the people actually working the tickets would've been beneficial when making these decisions.,
213,horrible tool,
214,"There are better tools, not a good tool for Cerner. We have a number of clients who have discontinued use of Remedy due to functionality and performance.",
215,Slow response time and times out too quickly.Emails for customer contact on CAM alerts.,
216,Why are there so many issues??,
217,search options do not seem to work well,
218,"Remedy is okay, but it is not very user friendly.  It would be great to receive notifications when a response has occurred.",
219,"Workflow is horrible. Too many settings, excessively long training, hundreds of clicks that could be done in dozens, etc.",
220,Slow. Search has gotten better.,
221,although i dont use this often i was not included in the training. and only two days were offered.,
222,"It's Remedy, will we ever be satisfied with it?",
223,too slow,
224,"Slow, clunky, search is slow and hard to use.",
225,Poor performance,
226,I work in Remedy all day long and train client sites on using it. It is so slow off campus especially that it is almost unusable. I feel terrible for our clients using it. It's very much a downgrade for them when they sign a help desk contract.,
227,"Remedy would be better if it was faster, and if we didn't have to go through a million steps whenever we submit change requests. CWx2 better be compatible with it by the time Navigator goes away",
228,Very slow.  Frequently hangs.,
229,cumbersome and slow,
230,I am VERY worried about the cutover to Remedy. Remedy is extremely slow compared to Navigator and I fear it will be even more slow when all associates are using it.,
231,Takes forever to launch,
232,outdated,
233,it's a chore,
234,too slow,
235,"The workflow is very comprehensive, but is also unnecessary in many instances. Although the entire process of ticketing is done within the one program, it also still takes longer than using 2-3 programs together (navigator, SRM, Pivot).",
236,Often takes forever to load.,
237,Needs improvement,
238,Too slow.,
239,Froze within three seconds of use,

244,Not properly coded,
245,No Alias Lookup,
246,ITWx could use their own Instance for CMDB,
247,cumbersome; many windows do not fit my laptop screen,
248,"Slow to load anything, and the Knowledge Base is absolute garbage. You can't find anything in it. Searches return irrelevant results or no results, and rarely anything in between.",
249,not a good performance,
250,Issues affecting availability of the Remedy service are frustrating and significantly impact my ability to perform job duties.,
251,Loads really slow. Receives random error messages. Crashes over multiple browsers..,
252,Not very easy to follow,
253,Slow and freezes a lot.,
254,Clunky and bloated... even being new,
255,"It is clearly hindsite, but we could have easily built a Service Management tool with the time and expense we spent over the many years we have been moving to Remedy.",
256,don't know yet,
257,"Begin using it next week; so far it is going to be a lot of extra, manual work",
258,unknown for managing client tickets.  Okay for internal but my past tickets are often not displayed.,
259,still not released on the time i am doing this survey.,
260,Very slow to load at times,
261,Slow in the german afternoon,
262,"not yet implemented, but I'll give it a chance. Like all things, clear, precise user-friendly instructions and contact person is never included; just vague comments glued together by someone in the Maldives.",
263,slow to connect,
264,I think this program is difficult to figure out and heavy on the clicks.,
265,I've yet to use this service.,
266,most of the time remedy is very slow,
267,"We will see, there are parts that seem like they will be better and other things that were useful to be able to do that are literally impossible with it.",
268,I don't use it.,
269,I have not really started using it as of yet,
270,Still learning it,
271,haven't used it much yet,
272,I find the system slow and unintuitively laid out with simple tasks that are available with one click in Naviagtor now requiring opening new screens and and taking much longer to complete the same tasks.,
273,Not used that much.,
274,"Have only done the training, haven't actually used it.",
275,haven't used it yet,
276,"Still new to me, but it seems fine so far...",
277,Unstable and slow,
278,it becames slowly recently,
279,Some workflows are a bit too complicated to implement,
280,not the easiest system to navigate,
281,Needs improvement locks up and gets too many error messages while we are working in it. Not convenient when on a call.,
282,It's better than it was 'out of the box' several years ago.,
283,Could be a whole lot faster,
284,"slow, slow slow...",
285,Tool is good but slow,

294,Have not used yet.,
295,Have not had to use yet,
296,It's way too complicated compared to what Navigator was.  I'm glad we can at least still use Navigator to search.  Training on how to use it was minimal at best.,
297,this is down or slow almost every day,
298,Huge pain to use,
299,THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT CERNER AS A WHOLE LACKS THE COMMAND OF THEIR PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM COMPLETE REMEDY. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY LITTERED WITH INCOMPLETENESS... WHY??? BECAUSE DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS DO NOT MAKE THEIR EMPLOYEES DO THEIR JOB AND BE COMPLETE WHEN THEY ENTER INFOMRATION INTO REMEDY... SAD.,
300,Ask me if I'd have wanted navigator back 7 years ago.  Never thought I'd see the day.,
301,Remedy is always having issues,
302,Extremely confusing and 95% of it is not applicable to job,
303,"So slow, reduces productivity severely",
304,Remedy is the worst tool for user friendliness that I've ever worked with,

310,it can't keep up and when it gets updated you can guarantee it'll be broken for a good month,
311,Remedy goes down weekly,
312,Remedy hinders productivity,
313,Very confusing to use.  Do not know anyone that likes using it.,
314,constant freezing and regular extended outtages have become weekly occurrences,
315,Help Desk relies on this for virtually every facet of our job and it fails on a regular basis. This makes our job extremely hard to do and I feel it that the functionality issues of this program hurts our reputation with our clients having to tell them that our ticketing system is down once again. It is an extremely frustrating tool to have to rely on.,
316,This is a slow and anti-intuitive program overall.,
317,I'm still unable to log a ticket in Remedy,
318,"I understand the need to standardize support clients, but Remedy is rediculously slow on some common workflows. Go to change a person's name or assign a client to an activity and it tries to do some auto load checking that causes the page to freeze for 30 seconds before you can select the box to add/replace the value. There's no equivilant that I've found to Navigator's Activity tab which allowed me to see tickets I'd recently worked on (and search for activities by type so I could look for Investigation activities by me, for example). Search is a joke. If I know a KB article and want to attach it, I can't do that directly but must search, then hit Relate. And if you put the exact CR number in, it still takes you to the search page and forces you to click Search before you can get results. It's harder to filter down results for the search because we don't have the sidebar anymore allowing us to see the way results are grouped and pick a particular grouping, like showing that I had 5 solutions and 1 CR and I could pick the CR to narrow it down. The results seem limited to 10 per page and there's no way to increase that, or make it scroll veritically to show more at once. Forcing Save and Relate buttons to the bottom of the page causes them to get obscured by those browser-generated tooltips that tell me things like javascript. The process of making solutions is now so onerous it's easier not to do them. Having multiple approvals doesn't work too well when your whole team is two people. Also while I was typing this Remedy froze and refused to load for almost 30 minutes, so the stability issues affect my ability to do my work. We use an in house tool to get around many of Remedy's shortcomings, SRM.",
319,WAY to slow,
320,requires too many clicks and dropdown options don't make sense,
321,I loathe this program and hate trying to figure out what browser it wants to work in this week.,

334,The up and down nature of Remedy is tough for my team.  We do our best to be an immediate help to our clients and it extremely difficult when Remedy is down.,
335,Remedy is too complex and nonintuative. I think Navigator was even easier to use.,
336,"New implementaion is buggy, but improving slowly",
337,The number of fields make it a jumbled mess,
338,"extremely complicated and difficult to use as quickly as i used navigator. I don't use it every day, so i recognize part of that is my own learning curve, but it still seems cumbersome when I am investigating a client issue just to get what i need",

360,"The searching of Remedy is very hard to use, it is pretty unintuitive, and it freezes and has to restart losing data all of the time, and is very, very slow.",
361,Cliumsy,
362,Remedy constantly freezes or crashes for offsite virtual associates.,
363,SalesForce or other CRM may be able to accomplish lead tracking and other need integration better.,
364,Its time to look at other solutions,
365,I do not like the long list when assigning which team the issue is logged to. Sometimes do not know which team to log issue to because the selections are not clear.,
366,Annoyingly overcomplicated and navigation is bad.,
367,Difficult to search for SRs and takes a while for it to load.,
368,Adding a CI for CRQ is a nightmare in this application.,
369,Inconsistent connectivity. Still experience bugs.,

376,Very slow,
377,"slow, always seems to go down",
378,"I'm not in there a lot, but the UI is not very user friendly",
379,"slow, but better in the closer part",
380,slow and many wait periods with inconsistent performance,
381,Slow,
382,takes a long time to enter in a ticket,
383,The search functionality is terrible.,
384,"Not the most user friendly tool, but it does get the job done.",
385,not really user friendly. plus today it is down.,
386,Would like better reporting capabilities to keep track of open AMS tickets,
387,loading time is too slow,
388,not very intuitive,
389,Worried that things get lots and hard to follow up,
390,I use very little in remedy.,
391,searches are not categories like it was with Navigtor search.,
392,haven't had much chance to use it yet.,
393,still getting used to it....there are a ton of fields that are required and it's not easy to know what team to select.,
394,Connection to Remedy has been intermittent the past two days,
395,I have only had Remedy training but I have not had to go through the process of submitting Remedy tickets yet.,
396,Better than Navigator...,
397,Have little experince with it at this time.,
398,I am a novice user.,
399,Not to user friendly,
400,BMC Software,
401,Connection issues,
402,Freezes or crashes,
403,Seems fine.  I haven't had a lot of use of it yet.,
404,"Clunky functionality, many clients installing or migrating to ServiceNow",
405,Still learning how to do a quick remedy search like we used to be able to do in Navigator.,
406,"Getting better since the OCSM cutover, but still a lot of performance issues.",
407,Good (better than navigator) but has gone down several times including today,
408,"There are some things which can be indexed better to make it run much more efficiently, but it is fine",
409,Too clumsy.  Should have specific training per consulting group.,
410,Lots of performance issues,
411,Sometime is slow,
412,Sometimes a little clunky to use.,
413,loads very slow,
414,So slow in general,
415,Good decision to move away from Navigator to Remedy.,
416,some slowness and quirks,
417,Slow and a bit clunky,
418,Could be expanded to cover more and also better UI.,
419,Availability Issues.,
420,have not used yet,
421,Haven't had to use this much.,
422,Do not use in my daily workflow,
423,Not used,
424,"Performance is terrible, not a very good tool",
425,"Each org needs it's own instance and ability to customize to meet the business needfor the client, example ITWx",
426,Worse than navigator,
427,Not user friendly.  Performance is slow outside the US,
428,"I hate interacting with remedy, and it doesn't manage config, so it's not a CMDB, it's an asset database. Chef manages configuration.",
429,A lot of performance issues lately. My team depends on Remedy to log tickets for our clients - this performance is unacceptable.,
430,Remedy is very slow and we are required to build a whole set of tools just to make it serviceable. Even those tools are unreliable though just because of how Remedy's acceptance of the messages we send it are unreliable as well. Remedy should be replaced by a service that works as we want it to out of the box.,
431,down all the time and when it's up it's very slow.,
432,Remedy is almost impossible to figure out even with all the information handed out. Many times even the champions don't have answers. I only log tickets during go lives and it can take me 30 mins to figure it out and it is always wrong.,
433,Remedy is incredibly hard to use and not user friendly. Additionally does not offer a good search option to search past tickets.,
434,Always having issues,
435,This is very slow and many options are just too complicated,
436,This application has issues a lot.,
437,Worst decision to migrate fully to Remedy when the application was not reliable before the migration.,
438,"remedy is a joke. And SRM is great, but if you're going to build a UI for the tool, why not just build your own tool??",
439,Remedy is super slow all of the time.  This is causing teams to find other places for data that should be in remedy,
440,Horrible program. Too many errors to many way to make a error.,
441,SLOW. What i used to be able to with SR Viewer in 15-30 Seconds now takes minutes and tons of more clicks,
442,Old EVTS was much better.,
443,Hate how it times out so quickly! Major workflow disturbance that I have to continually open a new remedy session due to timeout.,
444,not the best for productivity,
445,Remedy is not user friendly,
446,So very very very very slow.,
447,"very hard to navigate, log tickets, search",
448,"Remedy fields are not intuitive, nor is the order in which you fill out the elements of a ticket. My team has had SRs closed if a field wasn't correct.",
449,Slow to operate,
450,Very difficult to open tickets.  Remedy becomes unresponsive when trying to populate the required fields.  I still can not open tickets via Remedy because of the stability of the program.,
451,"Too many steps to get issues logged. eService, Remedy and Navigator should have all be consolidated into one universal issues logging system.",
452,much more complicated than it needs to be for non-support employees to simply log a ticket. must be simplified. why can't we enter via the same way a client enters a ticket? remedy is TOO much and often tickets are delayed because we couldn't decipher between one drop down menu item from another and it simply sits in a random que until someone says. oh wait. this is wrong.,
453,"There are issues that happen with Remedy where I have logged issues and received an incident number but the issue wasn't saved. The secondary tab doesn't make sense and the entire process wastes a lot of valuable time for consultants. There should be a better, easier, streamlined process to know the team to submit an issue to and enter in the details needed for the team to troubleshoot without wasting a lot of time for consultants.",
454,Very slow and not intuitive to use.,
455,"Crashes all the time or freezes. Also, it would be really nice if we could add more than 1 attachment on an email out of Remedy. It would also be nice if we could put screenshots (without PHI) in the ticket. This would make explaining things better when tickets cross across different teams.",
456,Crashes multiple times a day,
457,"Navigator was more bare bones but seemed better for tracking multiple issues via filters, queries, etc.  Perhaps I'm not educated enough on Remedy, but quick and dirty search capabilities are huge.",
458,Slow,
459,fine when it does not freeze.,
460,Remedy is often down.,
461,Extremely cumbersome to use. It takes about 5 to 10 mins longer to log a ticket than before. The reporting on tickets is more difficult. More often than not either referencing a wiki guide or working with someone from SWx to help navigate through Remedy to generate a report or query. It is not an intuitive tool for end-users.,
462,Too many categories to have to sort through when logging a ticket.,
463,Awkward to use,
464,have to click on the link to remedy repeatedly to get it to launch - can't connect to server,
465,Downtime and performance,
466,"i am a little disappointed we don't enforce this more...there are ""bolt on"" applications used by AMS And SWx that are developed in house.  we should be utilizing remedy to the fullest.  i also heard the help desk and FRT teams are getting Service Now?  why, when we have remedy?",
467,Often slow or down.  It is necessary for my job and puts me behind when it is not working 100%,
468,"It performs slowly and sometimes does not function that well at ITworks site.   It is ok,but not optimal.",
469,"Too much downtime for a critical Support system. Poor design/layout choices in the default configuration, which make navigation slow.",
470,"Too bulky, the software is bloated in the fact that there are tons of uses that are needed for the majority of users.",
471,I wish the email communications sent through Remedy went through Outlook (like the old Navigator),
472,Very poor searching still,
473,"Performance is awful, lots of extra field we don't use.",
474,very difficult to use,
475,"Once you learn how to use it, it's OK. But we really need a better alternative. My workflow in this tool takes three times as long vs SR Viewer (even Navigator)",
476,always down,
477,hard to track progess and the application is slow to load,
478,not user friendly interface,
479,Drop down take forever to populate,
480,"painful to use, we have another tool SRM on top that is often slow/broken",
481,It is slow. Takes too long to respond when clicking in fields to type. Does not respond and will lose unsaved data. Cannot transparently see closes without complex query. KB searches are limited by solution and Remedy freezes every time you search something.,
482,"Too many fields, too slow and clunky.",
483,not as easy to use as navigator.  seem to be set up for those involved in troubleshooting rather than those who log the issues.,
484,Not very user frindly,
485,Tool very slow to load and inability to modify tickets is a step back from Navigator,
486,"Not as easy to find things as in Navigator.  But, connection from other browsers is nice.",
487,Very slow loading times.,
488,multiple issues weekly loading remedy,
489,Hard to use,
490,Difficult to remail loggen into for extended periods.,
491,"Remedy is good for logging tickets, but working on the back end can be cumbersome.",
492,times out,
493,slowness,
494,The UI is really rough and hard to use.  Why didn't we just use JIRA?,
495,"It malfunctions too often, causing our calls to suffer and our work flow to be stalled.",
496,Non intuitive. Oftern requires specific templates to complete a request.  simply too many fields.,
497,it seems to crase a lot,
498,I'm not enjoying it but maybe in time it will get better.  It hangs is is very slow.,
499,Remedy is excellent for Incident and KB functions but is horrible in the early phases as a Change Management tool.  Improvements cannot come quick enough.,
500,It's completely slow some times. Looks like more server farming needed.,
501,Hard to use,
502,Extremely slow,
503,"Not intuitive, tends to be slow",
504,Not always cooperative with connectivity,
505,lately login only after several attempts,
506,its slow,
507,"Too slow, which I'm sure is a common complaint, sorry!",
508,The fact that we have to use the SRM tool indicates Remedy doesn't have all the functionality we truly need.,
509,Slow,
510,"altough better than navigator, it is still not ideal as there are several extra steps and clicks that could be avoided (e.g. attach a file, select the right categorization tiers, etc)",
511,"Approval Central for KBs needs to be improved, lots of lag/delays to approve any KBs.",
512,sometimes it too slow to use,
513,Can be slow at times. If other functions such as submitting a change could have a user interface like ASK it would be awesome.,
514,Would like to see improved performance.,
515,Not in use yet,
516,"Just started, will eventually use Remedy.",
517,not sure what this is,
518,Haven't used as of yet,
519,"I would like to use Remedy, but my permissions are overly restricted",
520,"i work on a team that manages a support queue. we know we have outdated KBs, but we can't identify them because we have zero access to view the KBs that the help desk associates to the tickets. so we keep getting incorrect tickets routed to us.",
521,"You know it's bad when Clients warn you, ""You know it is awful and we went to ServiceNow, right?""",
522,"Slow, buggy, cumbersome to use",
523,Data isn't very good in Remedy. Workflows are not customizable Lack of other product integration such as JIRA,
524,I work in support. I need this tool to be available and up 100% of the time. I can't afford downtime and the timeout period is ridiculously short. Constantly having to refresh and then bring up ticket is extremely annoying and frustrating. Not to mention the  inconsistency in the columns displayed on incident monitor vs. reports.,
525,Too slow. Too unreliable.,
526,Almost a dozen mouse clicks to open a file that a client added through eService; this really slows me down (Navigator was way better on file management).  Search does not work very well; Navigator wins again in being able to search old SRs for related content or grouping old SRs by team to see who likely supports functionality.,
527,Poor performance and connectivity. Very time consuming to navigate and complete incident requests. If our Cerner EMR performed like this we would be out of business.,
528,"One of the worst parts of my day is when I have to log a ticket, or look at someone else's ticket. Or scroll down 3 different scroll bars because the webpage wont resize. Or I research an issue, write an email via the reply feature in remedy and its timed  out resulting in my email being lost. Making it harder and slower to access SR's does not make anybody happy. And its so slow.",
529,"Very slow. No child tickets. no ""convert to change"" button to make incidents changes.",
530,"working remotely, Remedy is extemely slow.  It does seem to be down quite a bit for one reason or another",
531,"This is one of the worst tools I have ever used, especially when I only use it every other month. Our SMS/Siemens mainframe-based ticekting system was easier to use.",
532,Create and searching for incidents are slow and cumbersome - it should be a quick and easy and when you are in the middle of troubleshooting it really SLOWS you down.,
533,worst interface in the history of UX.  would seem BMC intentionally instructed their developers to make the worst interface.,
534,Really slow at remote offices. Keeps hanging and browser crashes.,
535,"Horrible.  Never stays connected, not all of our apps are in the system, worst software I've ever used",
536,Perhaps the worst software I have ever used. Please replace ASAP.,
537,User interface is not intuitive,
538,this was a huge step back in tools for support. slows down productivity due to it's limitations.,
539,I didnt think anything could be worse then Navigator but then Remedy came along.,
540,"Locks up daily, overly convoluted",
541,"Navigator had its flaws, but it was lightyears better than Remedy.",
542,Never thought I'd want Navigator back. Remedy is clunky and painfully slow.,
543,The system is too slow to respond and move screen to screen,
544,"Clunky, slow, and hard to learn.",
545,Often down.   Often errors.   doesn't efficiently meet our needs.    It requires a lot more work and time.   Non-effective reporting capabilities.,
546,"Almost as bad as Navigator, but at least I was used to that crappy tool.",
547,I find remedy to be remarkably non-intuitive. As an infrequent user it is alwasy difficult to find the meaningful information needed.,
548,"Slow, frequently problematic",
549,it is difficult to  know which group to assign your ticket to.,
550,"A beast to work in. From a frontline perspective, slow and ugly.",
551,"Counter-intutive, too many menu options that seem irrelevant.",
552,Not very itutiive on what should be filled out and how certain fields should be set.,
553,"Remedy is horribly clunky and slow, and is down almost every week. I don't understand why other ticketing systems have not been considered or implemented.",
554,Crashes a lot/jsays there isn't connection after being inactive for a little while.,
555,I find the system to be clunky and the UE is not good. Takes too long to enter at ticket and not easy to navigate,
556,No ability to scroll between tickets from within the ticket.,
557,Slow in CME,
558,"Does anybody really understand Remedy? If so, I haven't yet met that person.",
559,"Specifically regarding Knowledge Management, this tool lacks the ability to create a parent-child hierarchy that supports a navigable ""knowledge base"" in the way that ucern wiki can support",
560,There have been many application issues recently,
561,"Ease of use, limited functionality.",
562,Slow,
563,Constant crashes,
564,Tickets are being closed before they are truly resolved and my role lost the ability to reopen tickets so I have logged 3-4 tickets for the exact same issue.,
565,The tool is slow and frequently has issues that have to be resolved in KC.,
566,Access to PHI is always an issue. I cannot access this information when I am on-call.,
567,"Issues with login, SR Viewing and navigator had a handy tool that alerted you on your desktop to a new update when necessary",
568,Need a better way to view SR conversation stream,
569,Always crashes.,
570,Not intuative and slow,
571,Bad user interface not able to use it,
572,so much harder than Navigator SRs,
573,"Remedy is frequently slow and I find it difficult to log tickets, still better than navigator was.",
574,We are forced to use incident module for RFI tickets. The communication functionality is lacking.,
575,Slow,
576,"I'm slowly starting to get used to this application.  It's not the most user friendly thing.  Reading through tickets and multiple entries is very time consuming.  The layout is not user-adjustable and appears to make everything important REALLY small.  It provides lots of needless information in big font, and all the useful information in small sections.",
577,Remedy is even slower than Navigator.  I am surprised that it was approved to be rolled out to be honest.,
578,"Remedy is confusing to me, an engineer who uses JIRA.",
579,Very slow,
580,Very slow at most times,
581,difficult to know who to assign a ticket to. Lots of unmonitoried queues. Confusion when assigning tiers.,
582,"extremely slow, not intuitive",
583,too clunky,
584,"slow, horrible search, not intuitive workflow",
585,this tool is not user friendly.  Can you believe I like Navigator better???,
586,The  performance speed is very slow,
587,Too many down times,
588,Messes up all the time.,
589,I have a hard time figuring out what team I need to send a ticket to.,
590,Remedy is not user friendly and clearly lacking.,
591,"Navigator functioned better and was more user-friendly, but I understand Remedy has modules and ITIL-processes that Navigator didn't have",
592,Working in Remedy is painful and we have to enable features/Values available to enable data analysis.,
593,Performance could be better,
594,Slow,
595,Slow performance / downtimes are too common,
596,"For those inexperienced, it is very hard to use",
597,"more cumbersome to view tickets, close tickets, audit tickets, and pull reports",
598,"Soooooo Slowwwwwww. My client has ServiceNow, so I operate in both systems and it feels like this tool was built for a different era. It might be the fact I am 100% virtual, but it takes so long to do anything.",
599,"Difficult to use, cannot search old SRs.",
600,Tool is not very user friendly or intuitive,
601,Somehow slower than Navigator which no one thought was possible.,
602,"Remedy notification workflow is not the best for an onsite tech support. I had to create 3 rules for updates on tickets, emails sent to remedy from customers and whenever an incident is assigned to me. Notifications(whenever incident is updated etc) works for active users. I am an onsite tech so I can't be active on remedy for 8 hours. The mobile version of remedy is not very functional, and whenever receiving remedy emails on my Cerner iphone I cant even open the remedy update. I suggest the content of update be displayed in the remedy email. Also, I suggest onsite tech support be provided with an Ipad from where you can be active in Remedy when walking to customer's location and also view the incident directly from Ipad and so the response time is faster.",
603,Slow and not intuitive to use. Frustrating often.,
604,Slow,
605,bit slow,
606,Very slow performance,
607,not very user friendly,
608,Tool tips would help a lot. There is a JavaScript box that lives in teh lower left of my page and covers needed buttons.,

617,On learning curve,
618,Just getting started,
619,slowness,
620,I haven't had to use Remedy yet but know i have a learning curve,
621,often very slow,
622,It is more difficutl to run queries and do analysis in remedy compared to navigator.,
623,Better than Navigator. Can still be very difficult to figure out what to fill in for different fields,
624,"Slow, but works",
625,"Remedy webpage would never load over the last few months, but last week it worked as normal",
626,Glad I don't utilize this all of the time because the tool isn't very customized to Cerner terminology and we should have much better reporting that comes out of this both for individuals and at executive level leadership views.,
627,"Better, but still slow",
628,Many times it is slow or non-responsive,
629,Overall good for logging issues but I see minor errors from time to time that we are just told to ignore.,
630,while potentially aggrivating it's a lot better than navigator,
631,I find it difficult to find the information I need in it when I'm searching through issues trying to find an answer.,
632,Not very intuitive. Unless you use it all the time often difficult to figure out. Frequently times out by the time you enter information,
633,Better if its more faster,
634,better than navigator,
635,Seems to be unavailable a lot,
636,Any updates in Remedy will not trigger email to concerned parties.,
637,Better performance than in the past,
