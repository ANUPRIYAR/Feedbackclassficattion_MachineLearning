1,"I have no idea why this is a separate ticket system, and I have never succeeded in making the UI work.",1,0,0
2,Incredibly cumbersome and clunky (TAG Tasks for example).  Not easy to navigate at all.  Not intuitive.  Advanced searching practically requires coding experience.  Knowledge base searching is also less than ideal.,1,0,0
3,Hard to be satisfied with a tool that makes it so hard to do your job.,1,0,0
4,Remedy is terrible. slow. times out ALL THE TIME. the dropdowns for selecting a client mnemonic are terrible - does anyone from the Remedy team actually use them? Why are they so bad?!?,0,1,0
5,Tool is so slow and constantly hangs.  Especially in Asset Management.  Just a mess in general.,0,1,0
6,"Remedy is the worst issue tracking software I've evere used.  Some of my IT industry friends asked what we used and were surprised that a company like Cerner uses Remedy. It's hard to navigate, we close tickets, and then the next day they show back up in our queue wiht all the information lost, we can't tell who is ticket dumping because we only see their Cerner log in ID and can't contact  them via Skype for more info since we can no longer look up their names",1,0,0
